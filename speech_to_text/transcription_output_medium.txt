 Ok, vamos começar o vídeo em 3, 2, 1, sincronizar o audio. Hello, hello everyone, for those who don't know me, my name is Guilherme, and today I'm going to teach you a solution for a very common problem that I'm sure, like, probably you already struggle with. And for that I want to share my screen. Ok? Let's say, and that's very common, I have a computer and I'm going to perform a potentially dangerous activity, for example, testing a new software or, yeah, a new program or something that I want to, that I can't simply in a secure way run into my laptop directly. And that's basically it. That's basically the problem. And this kind of approach, running potential danger activity on your computer is a problem, something that I do not advise you to do. For example, let's say I want to test environment for a new, like, anything. Don't. Usually it's not a good idea. Never do it. So, what do I do? Let's say I have a process that I want to train on or anything. What do I do? And the approach I like, that I'm using, like, more frequently these days, is simply that I have my computer, like, the way it was before. But before I do this potentially dangerous activity or install anything that could mess up with my files, I usually rely on this very charismatic way that we call Docker. Of course, we could use virtual machines or something more complex, but I simply, I like things simple. I like to do things, like, rapidly so I can always have my environments separated, isolated, the way I can play around however I want without, you know, incurring the danger of doing something wrong that's going to break my computer. So, basically what I'm going to do is to create another computer, in this example, and you build a computer inside Docker. Basically creating a container. Basically creating another computer, a small instance of it inside my home. And I can simply interact with it on my terminal or in other tools. So, I'll be typing the commands, but they're not going into, I'd say, not directly into my laptop. They're occurring there in that separate space. And if it breaks, it's okay. I can just reboot it again. And more than that, it is reproducible. So, let's say I create this environment that is really useful for me for a specific task, and I want it to be reproducible on your computer. So, I could just send you the blueprint for this image and you could run the exact same steps on your computer because the computer physically is different, but the container is the same because you're building using the same blueprint. And that's the solution. That's the right way to do it. So, let's implement that. I created this very simple step-by-step guide, but the first thing we're going to have to do is to install Docker from Docker.com. You have various ways to do that. And I'm using my MacBook. So, for me, I would just come here and download the package, the DMG file, and install it. Once I do that, I can start using it on my terminal. Okay, however, let's say you already installed Docker. I'm going to create a file. I already did that for my project. Let's go to my terminal and change directory. This file. Okay, I'm there. And from there, I'm going to create a Docker.com. I could do it inside my terminal, but I use my ID just because I think it's more friendly. I already created that. Let's delete it. Move to trash. Delete, delete so I can start fresh. Okay, so I have this file. I created this Docker test. And from there, I'm going to create another file called Docker.com. That's basically the kind of the blueprint you're going to use to our subsystem. That's our container. So, Docker.com. Not. That's the file extension. And I'm going to use this code here. And what it contains, basically, I'm listening to the services I'm going to create. And I'm creating this Ubuntu test server that is a container that is going to use the image that is like a blueprint. It's like a system that is there on Docker Hub. Basically, I'm creating a Ubuntu system that I'm going to call Ubuntu container. So, whenever I type Ubuntu container on my terminal within Docker commands, it will know that I'm referencing this specific container. Volumes. And that's very, very important because the systems are different. And those volumes are basically shared files that allow me to create files and save there and see what I created on my container. So, really important. I'm basically creating this folder called synced. Within this specific directory, there is going to be synced to a synced folder within my container. I'm changing the folder directory for the container to be synced. And I'm also adding this command part here that basically I'm saying that whenever I start it, just update the package manager because I want to spend time doing it after. And also, I'm executing this command that basically does nothing but it keeps the container alive. Without it, and that's usually the case, that's usually the intended case when you use a container. It usually does something and it disappears and it's deleted. But not okay. We want something that keeps running. So, I'm adding this command, teo-f devnull to make it continue to be alive. And tty, allow me to connect directly to it within my terminal. You could delete it if you're not doing that because I'm going to teach you two approaches to it. But yeah, let's keep it that way. I think it's simple enough. Once I create that, I'm going to save it. And within this folder here, I'm going to cd docker-test-env. And the command is docker-compose-up. It will look for the docker-compose file and execute it. Tty not allowed. Okay. This is an indentation problem. Let's save it. Try again. Tty, okay, got it. This is an indentation problem. So, just fix indentation. Docker differentiates the tabs and spaces. So, that might be a problem eventually. Just ask Cursor to fix it for me. And then it's pulling the image from Docker Hub. I think I already had this here, so it was fast. And it's creating and initializing the container. Okay, so once it's done, it already created. I'm now executing those commands, I believe. I'll open a new terminal and type docker. Yes. And here I see my container running. And that's it. That's subsystem. That's another operating system running, isolated somewhere in my computer. And I have two ways of interacting with that. Let's try the easy one. First. I'm using Cursor right here. So, on VS Code and Cursor and other IDs, you have tools, you have extensions such as container, dev containers. And basically allows you to connect to a container. So, I click there, select my container, and it's basically creating a bridge between the container and my project. So, here I am. I'm inside my container. So, I could, for example, try to use Python. And it won't do it because there's no Python. I just installed this clean image of Ubuntu on this container. So, I'll just apt install Python. We don't need sudo here because I'm already root. And it's installing Python. Oh, no. Not Python. Python 3. And yeah, it's installing. So, I get my type T instead of Y. Yeah, installing Python. Let me select my region. And let's say I can see my CD here. But let's say I'm in Recivy 127. OK. I probably typed the wrong region, but it's OK. And yeah, Python installed. Let's try it out. Python 3. And let's create a variable. Let's say A equals a list that is X squared for X in range 10. Let's display A. And here it is. X zero squared, one squared, two squared, etc. And then, yeah, it works. I could also open a folder within there where it's synced. And whatever I create here will be created also outside my container. So, let's create a file. Let's say fibonacci. fib.py. And I'm going to create on one of those programs that give you the fibonacci sequence output to a specific digit. I have it here. Just to make sure I don't incur any indentation. Fix any indentation problem. Thanks cursor. And yeah, fix. Save. And now I'm going to interact with it in another way. I'll connect in my normal terminal from my system. Here, let's create a new terminal. And I'll type Docker, Xact, IT, Ubuntu container, bash. That's basically creating this bash terminal connected to my container. So, do that. And here I am. I'm on the synced folder there. And if I just type ls to list directory, everything that's there, I can see fib.py. And since Python is already installed, I'll just type Python 3, fib.py. And here are the first 10 fibonacci numbers. That's basically it. That's an isolated environment. With then Docker. That I could just do whatever I wanted then and then discard it. So, I hope it helps anyone with that. I'm sure that will help me in the future as I constantly have to remember that. And that's it. See ya. And now I'm going to interact with it in another way.
