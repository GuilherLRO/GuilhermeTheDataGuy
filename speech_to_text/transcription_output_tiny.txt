 Okay, let me solve you. In three, two, three, two, three. Tencrumbs are water. Hello, hello everyone for those of you who know me, my name is Guilherme. And today I'm going to teach you a solution for us very common problem that I'm sure like, probably you're ready to struggle with. And for that I want to share my story. Okay? So let's say, and that's very common. I have a computer and I'm going to perform a potentially dangerous activity. For example, testing the new software or, yeah, a new program or something that I want to, that I can't simply in the secure way or run into my laptop directly. And that's basically it. Oh, that's basically the problem. And that's kind of a approach running potential danger activity on your computer is a problem, something that I do not advise you to do. For example, let's say I want to test and implement for a new, like, anything. Don't, usually, it's not a good idea, right? Never do it. So what do I do? Let's say I have a pro process that I want to turn on or anything. What do I do? And the approach I like that I'm using more frequently these days is simply that I have my computer. Like, the way it was before. Before I do this potential is the injury activity or install anything that could mess up with my files, I usually rely on this very charismatic way or that we call it a Docker. Of course, we could use virtual machines or something more complex. But I like things simple. I like to do things like rapidly so I can always have my environments, separate, isolate it, the way I can play around, however I want without covering the danger of doing something wrong, there's going to break the computer. So basically what I'm going to do is to create another computer. But I'll end this example and you build the computer inside Docker, basically creating a container. Like, I'm basically creating another computer as much as I can inside my own. And I can simply interact with it, of my terminal or another tool. So I'll be typing the commands, but they're not going into, let's say, not directly into my laptop, they're occurring there and that's our workspace. And if it breaks, it's okay. I can just reboot it again. And more than that, it is reproducible. So let's say I create this environment that is really useful for me at first specific task. And I wanted to be reproducible on your computer. So I could just send you the blueprint for this image and you could run this exact same steps on your computer because the computer, physical, this different, but the container is the same because you're building using the same blueprint. And that's the solution. That's the right way to do it. So let's run dots implement that. I created this very simple step by step guide. But the first thing we have to do is to install Docker from Docker.com. You have various ways to do that. And I'm using Macbook. So for me, I'll just come here and download the package, the DMG file and install it. Once I do that, I can start using it on my terminal. So let me go a little bit darker here. Okay, so yeah, let's say you are ready to call Docker. I'm going to create a file. I already did that for my project. Let's go to my terminal and change directory this file. And from there, I'm going to create a Docker. I'm going to file. Oh, I could do it inside my terminal, but I use my ID. Just because I think it's more friendly. I already created that. Let's delete it. I'm going to trash delete the delete so I can start fresh. Okay, so I have this file. I'll go learn with the data guy. I created this Docker task M file inside it. And from there, I'm going to create a another file called Docker. Compose. That's basically the kind of the blueprint you're going to use to our subsystem. That's our container. So Docker Compose. Yeah, that's the file extension. And then I'll use this code here. And what it contains, basically, I'm listening to the services I'm creating. This Ubuntu task server that is a container that is going to use the image that is like a blueprint. And it's like a system that is there on Docker hub. I'm basically creating a Ubuntu system that I'm going to call Ubuntu container. So whenever I type Ubuntu container on my terminal within Docker commands, it will know that I'm referencing this specific container. And that's very, very important because the systems are different. And those volumes are basically shared files that allow me to create files and save there and see what I created on my container. So really important. I'm basically creating this folder called SYNC. Within this specific directory that I was going to be synced to a SYNC folder within my container. I'm changing the folder actually for other container to be synced to be this one. And I'm also adding this command part here that basically I'm saying that whenever started, just update the package manager because I wanted to spend time doing it after. And also I'm making this good in this command that basically does nothing but it keeps the container in life without it. And that's usually the case that's usually been obtained the case when you're a container. It usually does something in the disappears and it's solved and it's related. But not our case. We want something that keeps running so I'm adding this command tail dash f, that null to make it continue to be alive. And T2y allow me to connect directly to it within my terminal. We could delete it if you're not doing that because I'm going to teach you to approach this to it. But yeah, let's keep it that way. I think it's simple enough. Once I create that I'm going to save it. And within this folder here I'm going to see the Docker test f. And my command is Docker compose up. It will look for the Docker compose file and execute it. Which why not allow? Okay. This is an indentation problem. Let's save it right again. Teach why I okay got it. This is an indentation problem. So just fix it. So the Docker is differentiated the tabs and spaces. That might be a problem. Eventually, I just ask her to fix it for me. And that it's pulling the image from Docker hub. I think I already had this here. So it was fast and it's creating the initializing the container. So once it's done, it already created them. Now executing those commands, I believe. I will open a new terminal and type Docker. Yes. And here you see my container running. And that's a subsystem. That's another like operate system running isolated somewhere in my computer. And I have two ways of interacting with it. Let's try to use the one. First, I'm using cursing right here. So on VS goal, I'm cursing in all their IDs. You have tools. We have like extensions such as container, deaf containers. And basically I'll use to connect to a container. So I click there, select my container. And it's basically creating a bridge between the container and my project. So here I am inside my container. So I could, for example, try to use Python. And it won't do it because there's no Python. I just installed this clean image of Ubuntu on this container. So I'll just opt and install Python. We don't need pseudo here because I'm already root. And it's in to all of Python. Oh, no. Python 3. And yeah, it's installing. I get my type T instead of Y. Yeah, installing Python. Let me select my region. And let's say I can see my CD here. Let's say I'm in receiving one, two, seven. OK, probably type the wrong region, but it's OK. And yeah, Python is installed. Let's try it out. Python 3. And let's create a variable. Let's say a equals a list that is x squared for x in range 10. Let's display a. And here is x 0, 0 squared, 1 squared, 2 squared, et cetera, et cetera. And then thought, yeah, it works. I could also open a folder within there where the sync is synced. And whatever I create here will be created. Also outside my container. So let's create a file. Let's say people notching. Feed.py. And I'm going to create on one of those programs that give you the people that should see for instance, frequency sequence, I'll put to a specific digit. I have it here. Just to make sure I don't incur any adentation, fix any adentation problem. Thanks for your cursor. And yeah, fix. To save. And now I'm going to interact with another way, with another way. Oh, connect in my normal terminal from my system. Here, let's create a new terminal. And I'll type Docker, Zach, IT. You boom to container back. It's basically creating this batch and this batch terminal connected to my container. So do that. And here I am. I'm synced on the sync folder there. And I just see if I just I allowed to list directory that everything that there. I can see if you've got pi. And since Python's already installed, I'll just type Python 3, fill.py. And here, here are the first 10 fee will not cheat, no verse. That's basically it. That's an infer, that's a nice, late environment. With then Docker that I could just do whatever one of it and then discard it. So I hope it helps anyone of that. I'm sure that will help me in the future as I, I'll probably have to remember that. And that's it. See you.
