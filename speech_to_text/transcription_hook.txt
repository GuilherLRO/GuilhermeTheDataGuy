 Ok, let's synchronize it. 3, 2, 1... Alright! If you, like me, and I bet you are, you like to keep things organized, clean, under your control. But, again, if you're like me, you're probably someone that's curious. You like technology, you like coding, you like to try new things. When a technology comes up, a new library, you just want to install it, and test it, and see what it goes. But this can be dangerous, you know? You install one thing that you don't completely understand, and then install another thing, and then tweak a configuration, and it snowballs. And before you notice, it's a mess. It's out of control. Wouldn't it be nice if you could just very easily create a playground, a virtual environment that you could easily just set up, test something, and if it works, keep it there, running, adding value to your business or to your project. But if not, you could maybe just delete it, and start again, with no further consequences. Wouldn't it be nice? Well, it is. Let me show you.
