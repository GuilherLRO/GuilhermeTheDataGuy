      "[03:14.240 --> 03:17.880]  There's indoor soccer.\n",
      "[03:17.880 --> 03:19.640]  So in this case, I do think we will\n",
      "[03:19.640 --> 03:24.800]  have to go to that item level to be able to distinguish.\n",
      "[03:24.800 --> 03:26.360]  And I think what's kind of challenging\n",
      "[03:26.360 --> 03:29.520]  with this sportswear soccer is that most retailers don't really\n",
      "[03:29.520 --> 03:32.520]  have a soccer lifestyle category,\n",
      "[03:32.520 --> 03:35.040]  and it's just more so a casual sneaker or lifestyle\n",
      "[03:35.040 --> 03:35.600]  category.\n",
      "[03:35.600 --> 03:38.600]  So trying to isolate what specifically\n",
      "[03:38.600 --> 03:43.760]  is soccer-inspired is a bit challenging with that in mind.\n",
      "[03:43.760 --> 03:47.280]  But yeah, Samba is one of them that I think\n",
      "[03:47.280 --> 03:49.120]  is a bit challenging, because it kind of spans\n",
      "[03:49.120 --> 03:51.720]  a lot of different categories, or could\n",
      "[03:51.720 --> 03:56.160]  span a lot of different categories, for sure.\n",
      "[03:56.160 --> 04:03.240]  And then with regards to Samba, what is coming into lifestyle?\n",
      "[04:03.240 --> 04:08.760]  I think the top one is definitely the OG.\n",
      "[04:08.760 --> 04:12.480]  From what I've seen in the web descriptions,\n",
      "[04:12.480 --> 04:13.840]  sometimes there will be an indicator\n",
      "[04:13.840 --> 04:18.400]  that it is an indoor soccer shoe, or it might say messy.\n",
      "[04:18.400 --> 04:21.240]  It might have a collab with a soccer player\n",
      "[04:21.240 --> 04:22.200]  that might indicate that.\n",
      "[04:22.200 --> 04:26.720]  But yeah, curious if you all have any thoughts there, too.\n",
      "[04:34.120 --> 04:38.040]  I'm literally looking at this indoor on their website,\n",
      "[04:38.040 --> 04:42.200]  and it says it's an indoor soccer shoe right here.\n",
      "[04:42.200 --> 04:43.600]  None of the nine number of people\n",
      "[04:43.600 --> 04:45.120]  need to be used to actually know that.\n",
      "[04:45.120 --> 04:47.360]  It was an indoor soccer shoe in the 70s.\n",
      "[04:47.360 --> 04:49.960]  It's a lifestyle now.\n",
      "[04:49.960 --> 04:52.920]  I'm not sure if they have any performance versions of it.\n",
      "[04:52.920 --> 04:55.600]  And there's like this is the one, specifically\n",
      "[04:55.600 --> 04:58.440]  the indoor soccer shoe.\n",
      "[04:58.440 --> 05:00.280]  Indoor leads with a classic soccer design.\n",
      "[05:00.280 --> 05:02.280]  OK.\n",

      "[05:14.840 --> 05:16.040]  It's under originals.\n",
      "[05:16.040 --> 05:17.360]  That's sportswear.\n",
      "[05:17.360 --> 05:20.040]  So this is under originals?\n",
      "[05:20.040 --> 05:21.360]  No, this one isn't an OG.\n",
      "[05:21.360 --> 05:23.040]  This is a white.\n",
      "[05:23.040 --> 05:25.160]  That's an indoor soccer shoe.\n",
      "[05:25.160 --> 05:26.680]  The title.\n",
      "[05:26.680 --> 05:29.760]  The OG is the similar items.\n",
      "[05:29.760 --> 05:31.320]  This one shows up as a regular one,\n",
      "[05:31.320 --> 05:34.720]  but it has indoor leads with a classic soccer design.\n",
      "[05:34.720 --> 05:36.360]  And then underneath, you may also\n",
      "[05:36.360 --> 05:39.560]  be interested in the OG version, which looks exactly the same.\n",
      "[05:43.040 --> 05:44.000]  We just put them all in.\n",
      "[05:51.800 --> 05:52.480]  And I don't.\n",
      "[05:55.560 --> 05:56.920]  I just didn't read his plate.\n",
      "[05:56.920 --> 05:57.840]  No, I know.\n",
      "[05:57.840 --> 05:59.160]  I just don't.\n",
      "[05:59.200 --> 06:00.720]  I'm on a hotty site now.\n",
      "[06:00.720 --> 06:03.720]  I'm trying to find a performance version.\n",
      "[06:03.720 --> 06:06.120]  The merchandising this is a performance.\n",

      "[06:07.120 --> 06:07.620]  Geralt.\n",

      "[06:16.600 --> 06:21.120]  Most of it, given folks, will be sportswear.\n",
      "[06:26.320 --> 06:27.800]  Oh, but it does show up under originals.\n",
      "[06:27.800 --> 06:28.640]  You're right.\n",
      "[06:28.840 --> 06:29.340]  Yeah.\n",
      "[06:29.340 --> 06:31.800]  Like, if it's in originals.\n",
      "[06:31.800 --> 06:34.360]  Or sportswear or oddity, it's not performance.\n",
      "[06:39.440 --> 06:40.560]  OK, that makes sense.\n",
      "[06:40.560 --> 06:45.040]  So if it's in originals, so if I were\n",
      "[06:45.040 --> 06:47.320]  to go to the Adidas site and the original section,\n",
      "[06:47.320 --> 06:49.120]  if it's not listed as one of those models.\n",
      "[06:54.160 --> 06:56.480]  And I can definitely come with some specific examples\n",
      "[06:56.480 --> 06:59.120]  of edge cases that we might be seeing that are trickier\n",
      "[06:59.120 --> 07:00.200]  for us to identify.\n",
      "[07:00.200 --> 07:00.700]  I would.\n",
      "[07:00.700 --> 07:01.200]  Yeah.\n",
      "[07:01.200 --> 07:03.920]  I'd be able to go with the two different sportswear.\n",
      "[07:03.920 --> 07:04.420]  Yeah.\n",
      "[07:04.420 --> 07:05.680]  I mean, Adi will have.\n",
      "[07:05.680 --> 07:08.840]  I don't see F series on the Adi row.\n",
      "[07:08.840 --> 07:13.080]  So IA3, that's, I don't know if they're manufacturing X\n",
      "[07:13.080 --> 07:16.400]  anymore, but F series is massive for Adi.\n",
      "[07:16.400 --> 07:17.000]  Adi Outdoor.\n",
      "[07:17.000 --> 07:23.960]  Yeah, they'll have actual performance versions\n",
      "[07:23.960 --> 07:27.840]  of Predator or F series for use on turf or indoor.\n",
      "[07:31.720 --> 07:36.000]  There, I forget the phrase, cross-merchandising\n",
      "[07:36.000 --> 07:37.000]  isn't the right thing.\n",
      "[07:37.000 --> 07:39.400]  But if you go to Adi's website and search\n",
      "[07:39.400 --> 07:43.040]  for kids' soccer shoes, Samba will show up\n",
      "[07:43.040 --> 07:44.720]  in the middle of the page, but it's still\n",
      "[07:44.720 --> 07:47.920]  tagged with originals and not sport.\n",
      "[07:48.920 --> 07:52.920]  So yeah, there's a sport under the thumbnail.\n",
      "[07:52.920 --> 07:54.920]  It's a performance product.\n",
      "[07:54.920 --> 07:56.920]  And if it says originals or sportswear,\n",
      "[07:56.920 --> 07:59.560]  and we're talking about Adidas, then it's\n",
      "[07:59.560 --> 08:01.040]  lifestyle or sportswear.\n",
      "[08:04.520 --> 08:06.000]  OK.\n",
      "[08:06.000 --> 08:08.200]  That's helpful.\n",
      "[08:08.200 --> 08:11.520]  Yeah, we'll definitely take a look at the data again,\n",
      "[08:11.520 --> 08:14.200]  just because sometimes with the way certain web descriptions\n",
      "[08:14.200 --> 08:16.800]  are laid out by retailers, they're not always\n",
      "[08:16.800 --> 08:18.880]  as descriptive as they can be.\n",
      "[08:18.880 --> 08:21.880]  So if there are edge cases, then we\n",
      "[08:21.880 --> 08:25.800]  can find the right product for the retailer and kind of map\n",
      "[08:25.800 --> 08:26.280]  it back.\n",
      "[08:26.280 --> 08:27.600]  We'll figure out a challenge.\n",
      "[08:32.920 --> 08:35.280]  Sorry, I didn't quite catch what you said.\n",
      "[08:35.280 --> 08:38.640]  Oh, no, I was just saying Adidas is pretty clear,\n",
      "[08:38.640 --> 08:42.280]  but if you were looking at a sportswear,\n",
      "[08:43.040 --> 08:46.720]  if you were looking at a Samba on Dick's Sporting Goods\n",
      "[08:46.720 --> 08:50.800]  or Foot Blocker, I mean, who knows?\n",
      "[08:50.800 --> 08:53.520]  The same shoe show up on Dick's Sporting Goods website\n",
      "[08:53.520 --> 08:55.320]  under men's soccer boots.\n",
      "[08:55.320 --> 08:58.720]  So it's not easy.\n",
      "[08:58.720 --> 09:03.000]  I think in those situations where you might have questions,\n",
      "[09:03.000 --> 09:06.920]  I would generally default to going to the DTC description\n",
      "[09:06.920 --> 09:08.760]  or categorization.\n",
      "[09:08.760 --> 09:13.400]  That's probably the best, only because the shoe we're\n",
      "[09:13.400 --> 09:14.880]  putting into sportswear right now\n",
      "[09:14.880 --> 09:17.640]  is showing up at Dick's under men's soccer boots,\n",
      "[09:17.640 --> 09:21.800]  and therefore, even though they're indoor.\n",
      "[09:21.800 --> 09:24.560]  And they still show up under originals on Hany's website.\n",
      "[09:24.560 --> 09:29.840]  So that's one of those trickier ones, but it really is.\n",
      "[09:32.680 --> 09:36.120]  I mean, there's performance product people wear as lifestyle,\n",
      "[09:36.120 --> 09:37.880]  but there's also lifestyle product people\n",
      "[09:37.880 --> 09:38.960]  wear as performance.\n",
      "[09:38.960 --> 09:43.000]  And so it becomes one of those things where the lines of work\n",
      "[09:43.000 --> 09:45.400]  in some of these major franchises where it'll\n",
      "[09:45.400 --> 09:46.760]  get a lot more detailed.\n",
      "[09:46.760 --> 09:49.040]  And we just do the best we can.\n",
      "[09:51.760 --> 09:52.440]  OK, gotcha.\n",
      "[09:52.440 --> 09:53.080]  That makes sense.\n",
      "[09:53.080 --> 09:55.920]  And yeah, definitely helpful to lean on the DTC description\n",
      "[09:55.920 --> 09:58.400]  so we can plan to do that.\n",
      "[09:58.400 --> 10:01.800]  Another question for everybody on the call.\n",
      "[10:05.120 --> 10:07.040]  I'm sort of looking here on the Nike set,\n",
      "[10:08.000 --> 10:11.400]  when do you want to have the conversation about how\n",
      "[10:11.400 --> 10:16.280]  we classify certain, and I'm thinking of Adidas in here.\n",
      "[10:16.280 --> 10:18.400]  Let's think of Gazelle as an example.\n",
      "[10:18.400 --> 10:21.680]  That is a training-inspired shoe if we\n",
      "[10:21.680 --> 10:24.000]  follow the letter of the law.\n",
      "[10:24.000 --> 10:29.240]  Adi does not treat it as training-inspired.\n",
      "[10:29.240 --> 10:33.760]  It's Samba, Spazio, the Oakland Rd.\n",
      "[10:33.760 --> 10:35.960]  So we don't have to answer this now,\n",
      "[10:35.960 --> 10:39.560]  but if we're thinking about the sportswear side of soccer,\n",
      "[10:39.560 --> 10:46.360]  soccer-inspired, I wonder how we want to do some of that.\n",
      "[10:46.360 --> 10:50.440]  Whether we want to treat it like other secondary research\n",
      "[10:50.440 --> 10:52.000]  sources might do it, or the way we\n",
      "[10:52.000 --> 10:57.640]  would want to treat it based on internal categorizations\n",
      "[10:57.640 --> 10:59.240]  where there's a lot of stuff that\n",
      "[10:59.240 --> 11:00.920]  doesn't have a soccer heritage that\n",
      "[11:00.920 --> 11:03.120]  is going to go into a soccer-inspired bucket.\n",
      "[11:03.120 --> 11:05.160]  So if this isn't the time for that,\n",
      "[11:05.960 --> 11:08.400]  I think it's a good call because I kind of got into that\n",
      "[11:08.400 --> 11:12.200]  with the skate-inspired piece, where some of it\n",
      "[11:12.200 --> 11:15.200]  skate actually goes into lifestyle in the first place.\n",
      "[11:15.200 --> 11:19.080]  But when you have the skates, you put in the skate-inspired\n",
      "[11:19.080 --> 11:22.280]  bucket, it was very specific.\n",
      "[11:22.280 --> 11:30.520]  And so I think maybe we do prioritize putting something\n",
      "[11:30.920 --> 11:36.600]  like the Samba, the Gazelle, the Spazio into soccer-inspired\n",
      "[11:36.600 --> 11:41.400]  because I think they're showing up here as well around me\n",
      "[11:41.400 --> 11:43.640]  into soccer-inspired rather than the round.\n",
      "[11:43.640 --> 11:45.600]  It's like, check, we want it in sportswear.\n",
      "[11:45.600 --> 11:46.440]  We all know that.\n",
      "[11:49.000 --> 11:55.760]  If we want to get to sub sports under sportswear,\n",
      "[11:55.760 --> 11:59.920]  retro running, Y2K running, global football-inspired,\n",
      "[12:00.600 --> 12:03.680]  we can have that conversation, I guess.\n",
      "[12:03.680 --> 12:06.880]  I think that's part of the listing that we gave for lifestyle.\n",
      "[12:06.880 --> 12:09.280]  Jason was the breakout for lifestyle.\n",
      "[12:09.280 --> 12:12.480]  The sportswear included skate-inspired, soccer-inspired,\n",
      "[12:12.480 --> 12:13.440]  et cetera.\n",
      "[12:13.440 --> 12:13.760]  Yeah.\n",
      "[12:13.760 --> 12:14.760]  OK.\n",
      "[12:14.760 --> 12:15.760]  All right.\n",
      "[12:15.760 --> 12:16.760]  Thank you for listening.\n",
      "[12:16.760 --> 12:17.640]  I'm sorry for that.\n",
      "[12:17.640 --> 12:19.040]  I just wasn't sure.\n",
      "[12:19.040 --> 12:19.760]  Thank you, Alan.\n",
      "[12:19.760 --> 12:21.240]  Yeah.\n",
      "[12:21.240 --> 12:22.200]  I know how this works.\n",
      "[12:22.200 --> 12:25.400]  So bowl is an example.\n",
      "[12:25.400 --> 12:27.600]  There's more brands on Dick's Sporting Goods website\n",
      "[12:27.600 --> 12:29.680]  that have soccer in place than what's listed here.\n",
      "[12:30.320 --> 12:34.000]  How are those captured in taking the brand franchise approach?\n",
      "[12:34.000 --> 12:38.320]  Plus, there's more models outside of the franchise listed\n",
      "[12:38.320 --> 12:41.720]  that we still want to capture of soccer.\n",
      "[12:41.720 --> 12:42.800]  Yeah.\n",
      "[12:42.800 --> 12:44.280]  So this isn't exhaustive.\n",
      "[12:44.280 --> 12:46.120]  It's not like if it's not on this brand list,\n",
      "[12:46.120 --> 12:47.000]  it won't be included.\n",
      "[12:47.000 --> 12:51.360]  I think this is just more so for those very specific brands,\n",
      "[12:51.360 --> 12:54.560]  making sure that they are being included and considered\n",
      "[12:54.560 --> 12:56.720]  as performance.\n",
      "[12:56.760 --> 13:04.880]  But with regards to if a shoe is a soccer fleet category on Dick's,\n",
      "[13:04.880 --> 13:07.360]  given that the web category points to that,\n",
      "[13:07.360 --> 13:10.440]  we will also include that in our mapping.\n",
      "[13:10.440 --> 13:14.840]  So the brand mapping is one layer, I would say.\n",
      "[13:14.840 --> 13:21.600]  We also use keyword distinctions, exclusions, attributes.\n",

      "[13:24.440 --> 13:26.240]  it's not going to be included.\n",
      "[13:26.240 --> 13:27.640]  That's not really the intention.\n",
      "[13:27.640 --> 13:29.400]  It's just more so we want to make sure we\n",
      "[13:29.400 --> 13:33.480]  are capturing the key performance soccer brands here.\n",
      "[13:33.480 --> 13:34.880]  And this is just a starting list.\n",
      "[13:34.880 --> 13:38.360]  Again, if there are other brands, models here\n",
      "[13:38.360 --> 13:40.840]  that should be included, definitely we\n",
      "[13:40.840 --> 13:44.120]  can add those too and include our mapping to incorporate them.\n",
      "[13:44.120 --> 13:47.080]  But it is really just one layer that we're looking at.\n",
      "[13:51.200 --> 13:51.960]  Awesome.\n",
      "[13:51.960 --> 13:53.240]  But yeah, that's super helpful.\n",
      "[13:53.240 --> 13:56.360]  I think as we dig into sportswear,\n",
      "[13:56.360 --> 13:58.560]  I think the field to play sportswear\n",
      "[13:58.560 --> 13:59.720]  is maybe a little easier.\n",
      "[13:59.720 --> 14:01.600]  But I think once we get into those sub-levels,\n",
      "[14:01.600 --> 14:03.000]  it gets a little more challenging.\n",
      "[14:03.000 --> 14:06.480]  So definitely as we get into it more,\n",
      "[14:06.480 --> 14:10.600]  we'll share what we are seeing and how best to approach it.\n",
      "[14:10.600 --> 14:13.360]  But yeah, I appreciate your guidance for sure.\n",
      "[14:16.720 --> 14:19.040]  So that's helpful on soccer.\n",
      "[14:19.040 --> 14:22.600]  Jordan, me, any other remaining questions\n",
      "[14:22.600 --> 14:26.600]  on basketball or running based off of the Nike team's\n",
      "[14:26.600 --> 14:27.120]  feedback?\n",
      "[14:31.960 --> 14:33.720]  I think on basketball, it's pretty clear.\n",
      "[14:33.720 --> 14:35.560]  A lot of the feedback from the last five\n",
      "[14:35.560 --> 14:38.040]  was super helpful, some of the obvious stuff.\n",
      "[14:38.040 --> 14:39.800]  Like if it's a football cleat, I didn't\n",
      "[14:39.800 --> 14:42.040]  realize Jordan was in football baseball cleats\n",
      "[14:42.040 --> 14:43.120]  at this point, honestly.\n",
      "[14:43.120 --> 14:47.400]  So that was just kind of an easy mistake to make.\n",
      "[14:47.400 --> 14:48.560]  But nothing else really.\n",
      "[14:48.560 --> 14:52.360]  If any other franchises like dunks, Air Force Ones,\n",
      "[14:52.360 --> 14:56.040]  Air Maxes, I think are all basketball inspired sportswear.\n",
      "[14:56.040 --> 14:58.400]  If any other franchises like that do come up,\n",
      "[14:58.400 --> 14:59.520]  I'll run them by you guys.\n",
      "[14:59.520 --> 15:03.480]  But I think we've got pretty good next steps on that front.\n",
      "[15:06.840 --> 15:10.800]  For running, I only have one clarifying question.\n",
      "[15:10.800 --> 15:16.480]  So in the notes, you mentioned that one of the 1.0 ultra boosts,\n",
      "[15:16.480 --> 15:19.440]  those should be classified as lifestyle.\n",
      "[15:19.440 --> 15:25.560]  So if it's ultra boost, but it's 2.0 or above,\n",
      "[15:25.560 --> 15:29.920]  would you consider those as performance?\n",
      "[15:29.920 --> 15:31.440]  I think so.\n",
      "[15:31.440 --> 15:38.720]  I just recently moved the Gen 1 ultra boost into lifestyle.\n",
      "[15:38.720 --> 15:41.360]  I think they're on, I don't know what number they're on now.\n",
      "[15:41.360 --> 15:46.160]  But I think anything outside of 1.0 would still be in running.\n",
      "[15:46.160 --> 15:46.920]  Great.\n",
      "[15:46.920 --> 15:49.160]  Yeah, thank you for clarifying that.\n"
